I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science, University of Munich. I received my PhD from the Department of Government at the University of Essex (2020) where I also obtained a MSc in Conflict Resolution (2018). In addition, I hold BAs in Cultural and Social Anthropology (2017) as well as Political Science (2015) from the University of Munich.

In my research, I use quantitative methods to study questions relating to political violence. More specifically, I am interested in the dynamics of armed intrastate conflict, the membership of rebel groups, external intervention in armed conflict, and civil-military relations. Some of my work on these topics is accepted, forthcoming or published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, Cooperation and Conflict, Conflict Management and Peace Science, Foreign Policy Analysis, International Interactions, Defence and Peace Economics, Armed Forces & Society, Civil Wars, and the Political Studies Review.
